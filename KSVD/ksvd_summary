KSVD:

KSVD is a sparse representation technique which denoises the image with by updating dictionary which contains sparse representation of the image.

It is noted that the PSNR of the denoised image increases rapidly with number of iteration and it is  poised after 20-25 iterations.


About KSVD Dictionary:

Traditionally, dictionary use to be one of the known set of transforms (steerable wavelet, Curvelet, Counterlets,Bandlets), but now dictionary training is performed to create the sparse representation.

There are two options for updating of dictionary:

i)Globally trained Dictionary: Dictionary trained different images.

ii)Adaptive trained dictionary. Dictionary trained with same image with different noise level.

Results obtained by adaptive trained dictionary gives better results compared to Globally trained dictionary. 

Patches are sorted in an ascending order of their variance in KSVD dictionaries.
