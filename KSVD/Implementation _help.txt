KSVD installation help:

-Download Link: 'http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html'
- Make sure OMPBox v10 is installed prior to installing this package.
- Unpack the contents of the compressed file to a new directory, named e.g. "ksvdbox".
- If you have not done so before, configure Matlab's MEX compiler by entering
    >> mex -setup
   prior to using MAKE. For optimal performance, it is recommended that you select a compiler
   that performs optimizations. 
- Within Matlab, navigate to the KSVDBox directory, and then to the "private" directory within it,
   and enter MAKE to run the compilation script.
- Add the KSVDBox package directory to the Matlab path (you can use the ADDPATH command for this).
   Do not add the private directory to the path.
- Make sure to convert 'string' to 'double' format for the numrical paramter imported from the parameter file. For eg: sigmaDouble = str2double(sigma); 
- You can set the parameter from the parameter file 'method_parmas.txt'.
- Enter "ksvd_denoise_demo" at the Matlab command prompt to generate dataset for denoised image.
